# Delegation tokens

Thus Delegation Tokens were introduced as a lightweight authentication method to complement Kerberos authentication. Kerberos is a three-party protocol; in contrast, Delegation Token authentication is a two-party authentication protocol.

The way Delegation Tokens works is:

1. The client initially authenticates with each server via Kerberos, and obtains a Delegation Token from that server.
2. The client uses the Delegation Tokens for subsequent authentications with the servers instead of using Kerberos.

### Token's structure

| Kind            | The kind of token (HDFS\_DELEGATION\_TOKEN, or kms-dt). The token also contains the kind, matching the identifierâ€™s kind.                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner           | The user who owns the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Renewer         | The user who can renew the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Real User       | <p>Only relevant if the owner is impersonated. If the token is created by an impersonating user, this will identify the impersonating user.<br> For example, when oozie impersonates user joe, Owner will be joe and Real User will be oozie.</p> |
| Issue Date      | Epoch time when the token was issued.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Max Date        | Epoch time when the token can be renewed until.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Sequence Number | UUID to identify the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Master Key ID   | ID of the master key used to create and verify the token.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
